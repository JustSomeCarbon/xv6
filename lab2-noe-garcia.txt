TOTAL time
Spent on lab     10:00 hours

The most difficult part of the lab was figuring out what peice of the os did what.
It took some time to read through the code and follow just how processes were initialized
and executed by the os, and where it would be appropriate to place the systemcall code.
I had initially placed the code in the sysproc.c file, but eventually wanted to move the
code to its own file, unfortunately i was unable to complete the process without breaking
the os before the deadline.
